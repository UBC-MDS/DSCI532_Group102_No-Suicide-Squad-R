*Note:* The code screenshots below do not currently include docstrings, but the working version of the app will.

### DESCRIPTION OF THE APP
The purpose of this app is to help you visualize suicide rates in different locations over time, and see how a variety of different factors (i.e. age, gender, and year) affect these rates. There are 2 main research questions the app aims to answer using 2 tabs: 

**Tab 1:** How does the suicide rate change over time, and what effect does continent, region, country, age, and gender have on this?  
**Tab 2:** How does the suicide rate of one country compare against the suicide rate of another country?

### Tab 1: Continent-Region-Country Analysis
#### Suicide Rate by Continent
**Step 1:** This graph shows the average suicide rate over time, by continent.

#### Suicide Rate by Region
**Step 2:** Are there any sub-regions you are specifically interested in looking at?
Select one or more sub-regions (arranged by continent) to view the average suicide rate by year.

Select one or multiple Regions  
[A dropdown menu will appear here with regions]

#### Suicide Rate by Country
**Step 3:** Are there any specific countries youâ€™d like to look into?  
Select one or more countries (arranged by continent) to view the average suicide rate by year.

Select one or multiple countries  
[A dropdown menu will appear here with countries]

#### Suicide Rate by Demographic Groups
**Step 4:** This graph will automatically show the average suicide rates for 12 demographic groups based on the countries you selected previously.

### Tab 2: Two Country Comparison
**Step 1:** Select 2 countries that you would like to compare (1 country per dropdown).  
![plot_2a_dropdown](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_532_Group102_No_Suicide_Squad/blob/master/img/plot_2a_dropdown.png)

**Step 2:** Select a range of years to see the average suicide rate for this time frame.

![plot_2a_chart](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI532_Group102_No_Suicide_Squad-R/blob/master/img/plot_2a_chart.png)

**Step 3:** Select one or more groups to see average suicide rates by demographics in each country.

[A checklist of the 12 demographic groups will appear here]
