# Team Reflection - Understanding Suicide Rates App

Note: This reflection was originally submitted as part of Milestone 3, but has been updated to include feedback received with Milestone 3. 

## What It Does Well 

- Our app answers 2 research questions in an organized and easy-to-follow fashion. It also allows for interactivity, and the tooltips display individual numerical values.

- The visualizations are separated into 3 tabs, allowing for better organization.

- There is a clear overall purpose and general instructions for the app listed at the top. There are also step-by-step instructions for each plot which guide the user through a narrative.  

- The Worldwide Overview tab includes a world map, where the user can get an idea of what countries/regions they may be interested in, and then further explore those locations in the next 2 tabs.

- The ‘Worldwide Average’ dashed line in Tab 1 allows the user to visually compare how the suicide rates for the selected region/country/demographic groups compare to the worldwide average.

- The app follows a consistent aesthetic/colour theme, which reinforces that the different tabs of our app tie in with each other.


## Addressing TA Feedback

#### Milestone 3 Feedback 

*You have to provide a teamwork contract for project 2 and put a link to it in the README.*
- **Response**: We have added a contract.

*When doing a pull request try to summarize the tasks that you changed in the pull request description.*
- **Response**: We received this feedback on Thursday evening; pull requests made after this feedback was received will include more detailed summary descriptions.


*It is a good idea to provide a sketch for the DashR app.*
- **Response**: As discussed with Firas and Hossam, we included screenshots that match the layout and format of our app. As a result, did not change this part of our milestone.


*It is always a good idea to provide a good and concise description of your app at the beginning of the app page.*
- **Response**: We had included this in our app (see above response; our sketches/screenshots are the same as our app). 


## Limitations/Future Additions

#### Worldwide Overview 
- The colour gradient might not be discrete enough for specific year ranges (large differences in suicide rates do not appear as significant changes in colour). 

- Some countries are missing data, and as a result, appear white. 

#### Tab 1
- There are missing data for specific demographics and years for some countries, so if a user selects these location/demographic/time combinations, the charts may look as though only parts of the plots have been updated, which can cause confusion.


#### Tab 2
- If the user does not open the graph in a full-screen window, the year range slider does not change in size, and as a result, appears squished.

- There is no option to “select all” demographic groups with one click; if the user wants to see all groups, they need to manually check each box.
